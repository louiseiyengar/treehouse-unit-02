#  FSJS project 2 - List Pagination and Filtering
This project (so far):
For this project, I took an HTML page with a list of students and divided the students into pages with a set 
number of students on each page.

I also put a search for on the top right of the page, and the search will be triggered by a keyup in the search input or
a submit of the search form.

The search will compare user input to the **first name**, **last name**, or **email** of students in the list.
