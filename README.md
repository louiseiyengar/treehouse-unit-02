#  FSJS project 2 - List Pagination and Filtering

For this project, I took an HTML page with a list of students and divided the students into pages with a set 
number of students on each page.

I also put a search form on the top right of the page, and the search will be triggered by a keyup in the search input or
a submit of the search form.

Some things to note: You can search by **first name, last name, or email**.

If you type one letter into the search area, you should see a list where first and last names match the letter.
To see the search paging, type the letter "m" in the search area.
Note: I intended my code to be read from the bottom to the top of my script.js page.
